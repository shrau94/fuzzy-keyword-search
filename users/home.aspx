        About Cloud Search
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify">Connecting wirelessly to the cloud through mobiles, tablets and other devices mean access to any stored data is no longer confined to a single desktop. Businesses are now able to stay online all the time.
In this way, important files and other documents are accessible anywhere remotely, and with an inherent level of security.
One of the many benefits of the cloud is that loss of data should never be an issue. Your important documents are stored remotely in a secure data centre where regular backups are made. The cloud is inherently less prone to disaster than local storage.</p>
